	<p style="font-family:Courier New;">A slam book is a notebook, popular among children and teenagers, that is passed around for people to write personal information about themselves or opinions about others, often in response to a set of questions. While a slam book can be used for positive self-expression, it also has a history of being a tool for sharing gossip and even mean-spirited comments or anonymous criticisms </p>
